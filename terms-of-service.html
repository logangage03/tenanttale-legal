    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring System</h2>

    <h3>How Scores Work</h3>
    <p>TenantTale calculates scores on a 300&ndash;850 scale based on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verified feedback from connected parties</li>
        <li>Self-reported profile information</li>
        <li>Verification status of documents</li>
        <li>Historical patterns of behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Score Limitations</h3>
    <p>Scores are informational tools, subject to change based on new data, not guarantees of future behavior, and based on available verified information.</p>
    <div class="note">
        <strong>Scores are NOT:</strong> consumer credit reports under FCRA, background checks, criminal history reports, or substitutes for proper tenant screening.
    </div>

    <h3>Your Consent</h3>
    <p>By using the App, you consent to having a score calculated based on your activity, your score being visible to verified connections, and receiving feedback from landlords (if you are a tenant) or tenants (if you are a landlord).</p>

    <h2>Tenant Screening</h2>
    <p>TenantTale facilitates FCRA-compliant background checks through TransUnion SmartMove. By using the screening feature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Landlords</strong> agree to use screening results only for legitimate rental decisions, provide required adverse action notices when denying applicants based on screening results, and comply with all applicable fair housing and FCRA requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Tenants</strong> must provide explicit written consent before any screening is initiated. You have the right to receive a copy of your screening report and to dispute inaccurate information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subscriptions and Purchases</h2>

    <h3>Premium Subscriptions</h3>
    <p>TenantTale offers optional premium subscriptions with additional features. Subscriptions are billed through Apple&rsquo;s App Store and are subject to Apple&rsquo;s terms and refund policies. Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</p>

    <h3>In-App Purchases</h3>
    <p>Certain features (such as property verification and tenant screening) may require one-time in-app purchases. All purchases are processed through the App Store and are non-refundable except as required by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>Feedback and Disputes</h2>

    <h3>Submitting Feedback</h3>
    <p>When submitting feedback, you agree that all feedback is truthful and accurate, reflects your genuine experience, and that you will not submit retaliatory or fraudulent feedback. False feedback may result in account termination.</p>

    <h3>Editing Feedback</h3>
    <p>Either party may propose edits to submitted feedback. The other party must approve before changes take effect and scores are recalculated. Rejected edits are final&mdash;the original feedback stands.</p>

    <h3>Disputing Feedback</h3>
    <p>If you believe feedback is inaccurate, you may submit a dispute through the App with supporting evidence. We reserve the right to remove feedback that violates our policies, adjust scores based on dispute outcomes, and suspend accounts involved in fraudulent disputes.</p>

    <h2>Property Verification</h2>

    <h3>Landlord Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>Landlords who register properties agree to only register properties they legally own or manage, provide accurate property information, maintain current ownership documentation, and update information if ownership changes.</p>

    <h3>Verification Limitations</h3>
    <p>Property verification confirms ownership documents were submitted. It does not guarantee property condition, does not verify landlord qualifications, and is not a substitute for independent verification.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

    <h3>Our Property</h3>
    <p>TenantTale and its contents are owned by Skill Tree Solutions, Inc., including the App design and code, trademarks and logos, scoring algorithms, and documentation.</p>

    <h3>Your License</h3>
    <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to download and use the App for personal purposes and to access your score and feedback data.</p>

    <h3>Restrictions</h3>
    <p>You may not copy or modify the App, distribute or sell the App, reverse engineer the scoring system, or use our trademarks without permission.</p>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. Please review our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for information about how we collect, use, and share your data. Information about how to delete your data is available on our <a href="data-deletion.html">Data Deletion Instructions</a> page.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimers</h2>

    <p class="legal-caps">THE APP IS PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; AND &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ACCURACY OF SCORES.</p>

    <p>We do not guarantee continuous or uninterrupted service, error-free operation, security from all threats, accuracy of user-submitted information, or outcomes of rental decisions.</p>

    <div class="note">
        TenantTale provides informational tools only. We are not a tenant screening service (screening is facilitated through third-party providers). We do not make rental decisions. Scores should be one factor among many. Users are responsible for their own decisions.
    </div>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

    <p class="legal-caps">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APP SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, OR $100, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.</p>

    <p class="legal-caps">WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR DATA, RENTAL DECISIONS BASED ON SCORES, ACTIONS OF OTHER USERS, OR SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS.</p>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Skill Tree Solutions, Inc. and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, your violation of any third-party rights, feedback you submit, or your rental decisions.</p>

    <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>

    <h3>Informal Resolution</h3>
    <p>Before filing a formal claim, you agree to contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@tenanttale.com">legal@tenanttale.com</a> to attempt informal resolution.</p>

    <h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
    <p>Any disputes that cannot be resolved informally shall be resolved through binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, except for claims eligible for small claims court and injunctive relief for intellectual property violations.</p>

    <h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>
    <p class="legal-caps">YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES INDIVIDUALLY AND WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIONS.</p>

    <h3>Governing Law</h3>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

    <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. For material changes, we will notify you through the App, update the &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; date, and provide 30 days notice before changes take effect. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>

    <h3>By You</h3>
    <p>You may terminate your account at any time by using the &ldquo;Delete Account&rdquo; feature in the App or by emailing <a href="mailto:support@tenanttale.com">support@tenanttale.com</a>.

    <h3>By Us</h3>
    <p>We may terminate your account immediately if you violate these Terms, engage in fraudulent activity, or fail to maintain accurate information.</p>

    <h3>Effect of Termination</h3>
    <p>Upon termination, your access to the App will cease, your score will no longer be visible, and historical data may be retained as required by law. Provisions that should survive (including Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, and Dispute Resolution) will remain in effect.</p>

    <h2>General Provisions</h2>

        <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any provision does not waive our right to enforce it later.</li>
        <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> We may assign our rights and obligations. You may not assign yours without our consent.</li>
    </ul>
